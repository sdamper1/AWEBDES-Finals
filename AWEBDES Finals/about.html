    <p>
      At Pet Haven, our primary goal is to create a world where no pet is abandoned or mistreated. 
      We aim to provide every animal with a chance at a safe, happy life in a loving home.
    </p>

    <h4 id="purpose">Our Purpose</h4>
    <p>
      Our purpose is to rescue pets in need, offer them care and medical attention, and find them the perfect forever homes. 
      We believe in making lasting connections between animals and their new families, ensuring each pet's journey is one of love and happiness.
    </p>

    <h4 id="story">Our Story</h4>
    <p>
      Pet Haven was founded by a group of passionate individuals who wanted to make a real difference in the lives of animals. 
      What began as a small rescue effort has now grown into a thriving community of volunteers and animal lovers who come together to save as many lives as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      We‚Äôre more than just a rescue organization ‚Äî we‚Äôre a family of people dedicated to creating positive change in the world, one adoption at a time.
